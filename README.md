This project estimates and visualizes the cost of converting dashboards to Power BI under two staffing scenarios: one using a mix of junior analysts and managers, and another using a single contractor. It processes data from Excel files, applies effort and cost multipliers based on dashboard complexity, and generates a bar chart and heatmaps to compare total cost and effort per dashboard.
